# Heart-Disease-Model

This study uses a dataset to dive into the issue of heart attacks, which affect many families around the world. By understanding the factors that contribute to heart attacks, we aim to help people make better lifestyle choices and take preventative measures to improve their overall quality of life. Our analysis also serves to educate and raise awareness about heart disease. The dataset includes 14 different variables—9 categorical and 5 continuous—helping us explore various aspects that might influence heart health. The particular focus is on predicting whether someone will have a heart attack (indicated by a value of 1) by analyzing the predictors in the dataset and attempting to interpret each value against the output, and against one another to see which trends follow throughout the statistical analysis . Through this, I hope to provide valuable insights for early detection and better health management and overall a better general knowledge.
